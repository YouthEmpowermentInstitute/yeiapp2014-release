	<p>On this page you will find quick tips when it comes to applying for any and all things. The process can be overwhelming if you do not know a few pointers, but these will help. </p>
	
	<h3>FAFSA Issues</h3>
	 <p>The FASFA application is a long process that requires specific information about your family's economic situation. That is why sometimes it is easy to make mistakes when filling out the application. FASFA will notify you if your application was "rejected", but do not worry! This "rejection" just means that you have to correct some information on your application. Below are some phrases that mean that you need to correct information.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Reject Codes</strong>: There was a problem processing your aid.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Signature Missing</li>
					<li>Discrepancies in tax information</li>
					<li>Not registered with selective services</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Schools must verify info for some students by having them send proof of:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Family Size</li>
					<li>Tax Information</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Extra Documentation</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Signed Statement of Eligibility</li>
					<li>Student Surveys</li>
					<li>Copies of ID</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>To correct this information you just need to log back into your FASFA account, make the correction, and resubmit. </p>

		 <div id="DON'T" class="ui-body-d ui-content">
			<ul>
				<li>Lie. If you feel like you need to lie when applying for anything, it's best to simply not apply in the first place.</li>
				<li>Give up. If you feel your energy waning or are getting frustrated, stop for awhile and then come back to finish. A 20 minute break will enable you to return refreshed and ready to complete your application.</li>
				<li>Forget deadlines. Always write deadlines down immediately after acquiring them, so you don't risk missing an important date.</li>
				<li>Procrastinate. Easier said than done, but by no means impossible.</li>
				<li>Rely on one scholarship. It could be an amazing one, a free ride to college, but what happens if you don't receive it? It never hurts to have a backup, especially when that backup comes in the form of more money.</li>
				<li>Wait until the last minute. Your senior year is not the time to begin worrying about becoming eligible for scholarships and not having enough community service. Go with what you have, and search for the hundreds of scholarships that are out there. Write and amazing essay, or learn to juggle, be taller than 6'2; you can get a scholarships for all of that.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		 <div id="DO" class="ui-body-d ui-content">
			<ul>
				<li> Make sure to apply for all the scholarships or services you are eligible for. </li>
				<li> Create a system of organization that will allow you to remember all the deadlines and requirements </li>
				<li> Be proactive and productive. Set aside time so that you are able to explore the numerous scholarships out there and begin the process.
				<li> Help others during this process. For example, if you come across a scholarship that does not apply to you, but applies to a person you know, then let them know! </li>
				<li> Most importantly begin this scholarship application process early! The more time you have, the better your chances at completing the most applications. </li>

	<p> The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) helps students with their financial problems as they transfer to college. College unfortunately is expensive, and everyone should have the chance to experience what colleges has to offer. This is made possible under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 where certain programs provide financial aid such as loans, grants, and work studies to students to make college more accessible to everyone. This page will demonstrate the simple steps that will guide you through the application process when applying for financial aid.</p>
	<p>Go to www.fafsa.ed.gov</p>

	<div data-role="collapsibleset">
		
		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h2>1. Fill Out Log-In Information </h2> 
			<p>Enter your first and last names into the indicated areas as well as your social security number and date of birth.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h2>2.Attendance Year and Password</h2>		
			<p>In filling out the FAFSA you're required to write your date of birth as well as your high school status. You will also need to select the school year and create a password for your log-in account.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h2>3.Complete Demographic Information</h2>
				<p>Next, you will need to put down your address as well as your parents PIN. If you do not have a PIN, the FAFSA website provides the option to create your own. After filling out your phone number and email, the last thing is to put down your gender and then you can move onto the next step.</p>
		</div>

		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h2>4.Student Eligibility</h2>
				<p> Now you will need to address what degree you wish to pursue. You will also be asked whether you are interested in a federal work study program, which is a connection to the college campus that will set up a job for you to work there.</p>
		</div>

		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h2>5.Select Housing Plan</h2> 
			<p> For entering your housing plan, you will need to decide whether or not you will be applying for the dorms or be living outside of campus. For those living on their own, the financial situation is relatively cheaper than living on the campus but then again this is often circumstantial depending on the college cost.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h2>6.Report Parent &amp; Financial Information</h2>
				<p>For this step all you need is your parents social security numbers, their names and birth dates, and the number of people living in your household. If parents are separated, be sure to clarify that.</p>
		</div>

		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h2>7.Review, Print &amp; Submit</h2>
			<p>Before submitting, it is wise to go back and not only review what you have checked off but look for places you may have forgotten vital information or signatures. After you have looked back, you are now ready to submit your FAFSA application. This will not only help plan your living situation once you have graduated to college, but will increase the chances of winning scholarships, grants, and loans significantly than everyone applying for college deserves.</p>

  <h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Student Loans</h3>
    <p>In order to get a student loan, you must fill out FAFSA. Loans are issued by the federal government, but the loan amount is determined by the financial aid. Your loan must be repaid within the amount of 10 years after getting your loan. The down side to having a student loan is that you will have to keep paying it and it will never go away.</p>
    
    <p>An Unsubsidized loan will give you money, and will start collecting interest right after you have gotten the loan. Instead of collecting interest within a year of you receiving the loan like the unsubsidized loan will, Subsidized loans will start collecting interest once you finish college.</p>
    
    <p>To receive your loan money must complete a MPN (Master Promisery Note) and complete the pre-disbursement counselling and sign the note. To pay your loans, there will be a small monthly payment made with your monthly earnings.</p>

  <p>The personal statement essay is the way one presents themselves to colleges. It is story that tells one's dreams, background, and highlights one's qualities that are not seen through test scores. This essay is crucial to the application process because it can define one's acceptance or rejection to a college.</p>

		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h1>What is a personal statement?</h1>
		   <p>A personal statement is a the writing that you submit when applying to colleges, so that they get to know you. This is the portion of the college application where you are able to show who you are and make yourself stand out from the rest of applicants.</p> 
		   <p>The personal statement can the colleges' system of filtering prospective students from newly admitted students.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div data-role="collapsible">
			<h1>How Many Should I Write?</h1>
			  <p> Many colleges such as UCs require two answer two prompts. You are given two prompts with a word count requirement that are designed so that you are able to illustrate the community you come from and how that has influenced your dreams/ aspirations. Also, private colleges may have different requirements so make sure to check because they can have ore than 2 prompts to answer. They may also ask for supplemental writing.</p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <div data-role="collapsible">
			<h1>What are the prompts?</h1>
			<p> The prompts differ for each type of colleges. The UCs for example have two prompts.</p>
                <div data-role="collapsible">
                 <h2>UC Prompts</p>
                 <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong>"Describe the world you come from — for example, your family, community or school — and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations."</p>
                 <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong>"Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud and how does it relate to the person you are?"</p>
                </div>
			<p> While private colleges have specific prompts to answer, so you should check the college's prompts. When you begin applying on the Common App, there you will find the prompts to the colleges of your interest.</p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <div data-role="collapsible">
		   <h1> What do I write about? </h1>
			   <p>It's called a personal statement, so it should be personal. Meaning it should be unique and reflective. It is not just an essay, but the essay should reflect your character. Colleges want to get to know the applicant that they know only by numbers, so make yourself open and make the writing more than just words. Make them speak for you.</p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <div data-role="collapsible">
			<h1> How to get the creative juices flowing... </h1>
			  <p> Although this is a personal essay, speaking to other about it is  very important. It is recommended that you speak to other about possible subjects, such as teachers and counselors. They can advice you on what to write about and help you revise your essay once you have a draft of it. By allowing others, they can advise you on "stuff" to write about because they can provide a different perspective. Also remember that you do not have to write a "sobb story" in order for it to be compelling an do not just talk about your achievements all over again because the essay should highlight what the rest of the application can't. </p>
		 </div>
 
		 <div data-role="collapsible">
		   <h1> Quality vs Quantity </h1>
		     <p>Many students believe that the more writing the better, but that is incorrect. Writing is not about length but depth. So remember to make your writing rich and clear rather than long and repetitive. </p>

		<h1>Community Service</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Community service is typically a requirement to graduate from high school, with each high school having a different standard.</li>
				<li>It is best to take this standard and divide it by four years, doing a small chunk of hours every year.</li>
				<li>It is recommended that you go above and beyond, acquiring around 200 hours of community service, as this looks incredibly good on a college application.</li>
				<li>This may sound daunting at first, but it is a lot easier than you think!</li>		
				<li>Try and find a way to get community service that you genuinely enjoy doing, then it won't seem like much work, with the added bonus of it looking nice to colleges.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1> Academics </h1>
			<p>You still have a lot of time until you take these standardized tests  but it is never to early to prep for them! These tests are called the SAT and ACT. The ACT and SAT are built to measure the material you are able to answer correctly too. They are coachable so do not worry about not knowing the content the you will be tested on. To get ahead of the game you can start by registering for the PSAT; this practice test will break down the areas you need to review before taking the official SAT/ACT.</p>
			<p>As mentioned before you should start early developing study habits that in the long term will help you. The sooner you learn what skills work for you, the more prepared you will be. For example taking the time to take good notes is something that will not only help you study but can also be used as a reference tool. This kind of system is very useful because it caters to one's specific learning skills.</p>
	</div>
	
	  <div data-role="collapsible">
			<h1>Social</h1>
			   <p>Over all the stress of the years to come find a group that supports you. At your local school look for a college club or talk to counselors. People want you to succeed but finding people to rely on is a different story. Find people that will influence  you in a good way developing skills that will further your education.</p>

			<p> These are classes that most sophomores take during their school year.</p>
			
			<div data-role="collapsibleset">
				
				<div data-role="collapsible">
				<h4> English 2 </h4>
					<p> By the time of your second year of high school, you must have had completed English 1 of your Freshmen year. Now, English 2 must be taken as an a-g requirement. English honors	is another option that may earn you more credits but as long as you are in English 2 you are on the right track. </p>
				</div>

				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4> World History </h4>
						<p> World History is a mandatory course that must be taken in order to complete the a-g requirements. If you are not in World History by the time of your sophomore year of high school then it may be a problem that you would have to deal with later which can become a hassle. Especially since the year to make up for classes you have not taken is senior year. Make sure this class is taken your Sophomore year and the a-g requirement spectrum is already well on its way to being completed. </p>
				</div>

				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4> Geometry </h4>
						<p> Geometry is the class that must be taken your sophomore year of high school in order to be on the right path to completing the "a-g" requirements in time for graduation. Of course this is assuming no summer classes will be taken in order to get ahead in the following years. If that is your choice to do so then great. If you are an incoming Sophomore who has already exceeded past Geometry then obviously you are already ahead and in good shape. Again this is assuming that you do not fail any of your math classes in the following years. As long as you are in Geometry or higher coming into your Sophomore year you are on the path for completing the math part in the a-g requirements. </p>
				</div>

				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4> Biology </h4>
						<p> Depending on your schools criteria, Biology may be taken either freshmen or sophmore year. Bottom line is that this course must be taken in order to complete the a-g requirements. </p>
				</div>

				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4> Foreign Language </h4>
						<p> A foreign language class must be taken for the a-g requirements schedule. Two years is mandatory for college, but three to four is recommended. You also have to be sure that however many years you take the language class, it must be the same language. Once you have established which language you will be persuing, you will have set your goals on the right path to finishing the a-g requirements. </p>

	<p>The Youth Empowerment Institute is an ongoing project designed, staffed, and implemented by students of the <a href="#giip">Global Information Internship Program</a>, which is an honors program at UCSC. YEI is free of charge and open to students at <a href="#wtec">Watsonville TEC</a></p>

	<p>YEI is a six-day and night summer camp held at the UCSC campus. Our campers stay in dorms and eat in the dining halls. We work on two things:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>
	    <h3>College Workshops</h3>
			<p>Campers learn about the ins and outs of college; how to apply, what to look for, and how to get financial aid.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	     <h3>Mobile App Programming</h3>
			 <p>We teach the creation of mobile apps using HTML and jQuery Mobile. These sound very complicated but are actually very simple. Students come in with zero knowledge of coding and leave producing apps like the one you are using now.</p><p>We want to make clear that anyone can learn to do this and in a very short period of time.</p>

	<p>Everett is a special program unique to UC Santa Cruz. It combines the passion that students have for issues such as education, water rights, women's rights, sustainable coffee farming, and homelessnes, and teaches them to create projects that will adress these issues in a managable and fundable manner.</p>
	<p>Everett students work locally and across the globe. Here is just a sample of what Everett students have done in the past:</p>
	<h4>International</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Training business women in Oaxaca how to use computer technology to enhance their businesses</li>
			<li>Computer and English courses for representatives of over 60 non-profits in Ghana</li>
			<li>Islamic family law and womens rights under sharia law in Malaysia</li>
			<li>Mobile health reporting and election monitoring in Ghana</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h4>Local</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Integral work on establishing the Watsonville Film Festival</li>
			<li>Film classes with Watsonville youth</li>
			<li>Computer classes at the Santa Cruz Homeless Services Center</li>
			<li>Providing technology support for the I Have a Dream Foundation</li>
			<li>Summer college/mobile app camp for Watsonville students</li> 
	  </ul>

	<p>Everett is a truly unique program and is always looking for motivated students who want to learn. We're always extremely happy to see Pajaro Valley locals, so if you decide to attend UCSC, please consider joining!</p>

<h4>Pacific Coast Charter School, 11th Grade</h4> 
<p> If by some miracle you opened this paragraph without telling yourself "what the hell? This isn't about FAFSA",  then welcome to this biography that you will forget in a very short amount of time. </p>
<p> I'm Immanuel (if you didn't gather that from the huge header just above) and I was born in that  "oh yeah I've heard of it" country known as the Philippines in Southeast Asia. At the age of six, I made my way over to California and started a whole new life. Jump ahead 10 years and now we're all caught up more or less. </p>
<p>I like eating. And sleeping. And telling myself I can play guitar.  I like reading (not a lie for my teachers), playing videogames (Xbox. Come at me, haters), and playing/watching basketball (Lakers. Come at me, haters part two).  But above all, writing and filmmaking are my passions. Despite what you hear from people, I am not a prick about movies. I am an EXTREME prick about movies.  </p>
<p> My life goals aren't very clear right now, because I'm still struggling figuring out my weekly goals. I just hope to experience more things that I've never seen before, meet some incredible people (which I have both done while working on this app.), and just love life no matter what happens. It's not a luxury to live and love, it's a privilege.  </p>
